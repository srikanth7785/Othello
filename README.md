This is a game I found Somewhere Online. I Felt interested while playing game..and then i got an idea..what if I write code to this game..
Of course without any graphics...then i watched a youtube video to get full clarity about how to play the game. After watching that video
I understood the game completely, then i started writing code for this game..play the game and give a star if you like it..
